This is quite differnt from languages such as C, C++, and Fortran, where one must compile human-readable code into machine instructions.\n",

This allows for a number of dynamic features which are not supported in compiled lagnuages. For example, the Jupyter notebook we use now would not be possible without an interpreted language such as Python. "

We also can see that we have gotten our first error ! The Python interpreter will report errors as they occur. In a compiled language like C, the compiler would have returned an error during compilation as it would have detected this type-collision as a compile-time-error.

Not having to debug memory problems is a big win compared to having to check types.
